% Consider the function                                                        %
%  u(x) = cos(k_max * x)                                                       %
% on the grid xj = j * dx for j = 1..m, dx = 2*pi/m, k_max = m/2.              %
% Compute by hand the approximation to u'(x_j) obtained by the pseudospectral  %
% method, and compare this to the exact value for u'(x_j). Why should we neg-  %
% lect the contributions                                                       %
